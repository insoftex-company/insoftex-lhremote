# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed

- `check-status` `instances[]` now reflects only genuinely running processes from OS process inspection (Win32_Process on Windows), not all 7 configured accounts from the launcher roster (R1)
- `instances[].cdpPort` and `instances[].connectable` now carry real values from live process probing instead of always being `null` (R2)
- Instance identity (`accountId`, `name`, `email`) is parsed from `--app-id`/`--user-li-id`/`--user-li` only — `--lh-account` (license-owner decoy, identical across all instances) is now explicitly ignored (R3)
- `instances[]` remains correct when the launcher CDP is unreachable; `launcher.reachable` is a separate flag (R4)
- `find-app` role classification: `--type=` present → `helper-child` (excluded by default); `resources\out\` path → `instance`; otherwise `launcher`; added `helperChildCount` per entry (R5)

### Added

- `gather-raw-processes` shared utility — abstracts OS process listing with cmdlines (Win32_Process via PowerShell on Windows; ps-list `cmd` on other platforms)
- `FindAppOptions.includeHelpers` — opt-in to show helper-child processes in `find-app` output (CLI `--verbose` flag)
- `StatusReport.instances` — authoritative process-inspection-based array (same data as `runningInstances`, which is retained for backward compatibility)
- `docs/instance-visibility.md` — process taxonomy, cmdline identity fields, `--lh-account` trap, redaction requirements

### Security

- Command line secrets (`--app-credentials`, `--upstream-proxy`, `--sentry` DSN) are never captured, stored, or returned in any tool output or log

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added

- Humanization layer for all LinkedIn interactions — Gaussian delay distribution, page settling, humanized mouse movement via LH's VirtualMouse, click jitter, scroll randomization, post-action dwell, character-aware typing cadence with word/sentence boundary pauses, CDP fallback mouse path, session-level pacing with cool-down and micro-breaks, idle mouse drift, pre-focus hover, reading simulation, and humanized retries
- Smart port resolution with direct instance connection — auto-discovers instance CDP port without manual configuration
- Dialog dismissal on LauncherService (`dismissInstanceDialog`, `stopInstanceWithDialogDismissal`)
- `connectUiOnly()` on InstanceService for partial-start resilience
- `CDPClient` export from `@insoftex/lhremote-core`

### Changed

- Feed posts now use URL as primary identifier (URN dropped)
- Feed and post operations migrated from Voyager API interception to DOM scraping for LinkedIn SSR compatibility
- `FeedPost.url` is now nullable with automatic retry URL extraction
- Explicit `cdpPort` required for non-loopback host connections
- CLI no longer defaults `cdpPort` to `DEFAULT_CDP_PORT`

### Fixed

- Override `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` to restore CDP connectivity on LinkedHelper v2.113.9+
- Prevent health check infinite recursion and fix campaign runner start sequence
- Detect wrong CDP port and classify launcher vs instance processes
- Wire dialog-aware stop into `forceStopInstance` and crash recovery
- Use webpack account service cache for `listAccounts` performance
- Discover instance port before popup detection in `get-errors` and `dismiss-errors`
- Add `Array.isArray` guard in `discoverTargets`
- Remove dead VoyagerInterceptor code
