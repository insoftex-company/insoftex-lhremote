# @lhremote/core

Core library for [lhremote](https://github.com/alexey-pelykh/lhremote) — LinkedHelper automation toolkit.

This package provides services, data access, and CDP communication for controlling LinkedHelper. It is the foundation that both [`@lhremote/mcp`](../mcp) and [`@lhremote/cli`](../cli) build on.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @lhremote/core
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {
  findApp,
  resolveAccount,
  CampaignService,
  withInstanceDatabase,
} from "@lhremote/core";

// Detect LinkedHelper
const apps = await findApp();
const cdpPort = apps[0].cdpPort!;

// Resolve the active account
const accountId = await resolveAccount(cdpPort);

// Work with campaigns
await withInstanceDatabase(cdpPort, accountId, async ({ instance, db }) => {
  const campaigns = new CampaignService(instance, db);
  const list = await campaigns.list();
  console.log(list);
});
```

## Development Notes

`AppService` is responsible for process discovery, launch conflict handling, and Windows desktop visibility. On Windows, visible launch uses native top-level window enumeration instead of CDP `Page.bringToFront`, because the launcher CDP endpoint can be reachable before it has any page targets. See the [Development Specification](../../docs/development-specification.md) for app lifecycle requirements.
